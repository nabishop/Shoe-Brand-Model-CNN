# shoe_identifier

Scrapes Solelinks for all past released shoes to get names, uses google images to scrape pics of shoes, builds directories based on brands and model for shoe, first runs CNN to determine brand and then runs CNN to determine brand from model predicted.

Got it about 99% accurate for brands but model was harder since images are not cleaned.
